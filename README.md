GuessNumber
===========

This is a small iOS application which requires a user to think of an integer in a given range, and then presents the user with numerous grids of numbers. The user is required to truthfully respond to each grid, stating whether their number is "present" or "absent." After the app has received sufficient input from the user, it presents the user's number on-screen. The app itself uses a simple narrow-down algorithm for such a process, and works 100% of the time, given that the user is completely honest.
